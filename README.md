# Pixel Art Console Renderer

![Screenshot_412](https://github.com/DevShahmeer/Pixel-Smile/assets/108333592/3e97c151-ccea-4140-90d2-eb6d82e2ecaf)

This TypeScript project is designed to create pixel art and output it to the console. In its current state, it draws a smiling face to the console. However, there were some bugs in the initial code that needed to be fixed and some functions that needed to be implemented. We've used TypeScript's type system to help guide our work and ensure the code is robust.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevShahmeer/Pixel-Smile.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Pixel-Smile
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To run the project and see the smiling face in the console, follow these steps:

1. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:

   ```bash
   tsc index.ts
   ```

   This will generate a `index.js` file.

2. Run the JavaScript code using `node`:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

This will execute the `index.ts` file and render the smiling face to the console.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the main entry point of the application and contains all the code for drawing various elements, rendering the pixel art to the console, and utility functions.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
